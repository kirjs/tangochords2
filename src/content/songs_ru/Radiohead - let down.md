[Intro]
A
 
 
[Verse 1]
A
Transport
               E
Motorways and tramlines
                   F#m
Starting and then stopping
                E
Takin' off and landing
                 A
The emptiest of feelings
             E
Disapointed people
                F#m
Clingin' on to bottles
                         E
And when it comes it's so so disapointing
 
 
[Chorus]
D   Dsus2    A        D/F#
Let down and hangin' around
D       Dsus2  A          D/F#
Crushed like a bug in the ground
D   Dsus2    A       D/F#     E    A
Let down and hangin' around 
 
 
[Verse 2]
A
Shell smashed, juices flowin'
E
Wings twitch, legs are goin'
F#m
Don't get sentimental
E
It always ends up drivel
 A                  E
One day I am gonna grow wings
             F#m
A chemical reaction
               E
Hysterical and useless
 
Hysterical and
 
 
[Chorus]
D   Dsus2    A        D/F#
Let down and hangin' around
D       Dsus2  A          D/F#
Crushed like a bug in the ground
D   Dsus2    A       D/F#     E
Let down and hangin' around

[Verse 3]
A                            E
You know, you know where you are with
                   F#m
You know where you are with
                  E
Floor collapsing, fallin'
                  A                  E
Bouncing back and one day
                 (One day I am gonna grow wings)
                           F#m
        You know where you are
(A chemical ------------ reaction)
                           E
        You know where you are
(Hysterical and ---------- useless)
 
        You know where you are
(Hysterical and)
 
 
[Chorus]
D   Dsus2    A        D/F#
Let down and hangin' around
D       Dsus2  A          D/F#
Crushed like a bug in the ground
D   Dsus2    A       D/F#     E
Let down and hangin' around
