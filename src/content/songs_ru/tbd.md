[Intro]
D/C  G/B  Gm/Bb  D/A F   G   D      (x2)
 
[Verse 1]
      D/C           G/B       Gm/Bb             D/A    
Come  down off your throne and leave your body a-lone
F     G        D     
  some-body must change
 
D/C             G/B            Gm/Bb       D/A  
     You are the reason I've been waiting so long
F     G             D
  some-body holds the key
 
[Chorus]
         G/B                  A7                  D    
Well, I'm     near the end and I   just ain't got the time.
Em7                    G           D/F#  Em D    
    And I'm wasted and I  can't find my    way home

Come  down off your throne and leave your body a-lone
F     G        D     
  some-body must change
 
D/C             G/B            Gm/Bb       D/A  
     You are the reason I've been waiting so long

  some-body holds the key

(x4)
 I  can't find my way home
       F          G      D
Still I can't find my way  home
       F           G      D
And I    ain't done nothing wrong
       F          G      D    
And I   can't find my way  home
